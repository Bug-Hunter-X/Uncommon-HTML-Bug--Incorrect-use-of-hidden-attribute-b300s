# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect use of hidden attribute

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the use of the `hidden` attribute in HTML.  The bug arises from incorrectly setting the `hidden` attribute to a string value instead of a boolean value.  This results in the element not being hidden as expected.

The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.  The issue highlights a subtle difference in how HTML interprets boolean attributes.
